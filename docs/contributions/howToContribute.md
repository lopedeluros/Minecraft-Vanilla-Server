Thanks for taking your time for reading this docs.

This is, by no means, a serious project, this started as a personal challenge for me to share with a friend as we were eager to start a new server as every year.

With that said, this is the first project I share through github, so I am pretty novice at this, so any recommendations would be appreciated for self improvement.

If you have more rich ideas about how to automatize deployment processes more easily than those shell scripts these ideas are welcome, either by a Pull Request or an Issue.

Any idea for the bot is also welcomed although I still have some for a future.
